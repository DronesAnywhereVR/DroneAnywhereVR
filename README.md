8. Paste the panoID into the text box in the DronesAnywhereVR Selector App
9. Click 'Submit' and wait until a MemberID is generated

### Step 4: Open the DronesAnywhereVR App on the Quest 3

1. Open the DronesAnywhereVR app on the Quest 3
2. This will be in the 'Apps' Section of the Quest 3 (Bottom ribbon, More Apps)
3. Sort by Unknown Sources
4. Open the DronesAnywhereVR app

### Step 5: In the VR app

1. When the app opens up, use the right controller to navigate the menu
2. The menu can be opened and closed with the 'B' Button
3. Navigate the menu with the thumb stick
4. Select the relevant memberID from the list of 8 numbers (or the pre-set locations)
5. Wait for around 5 seconds for the scene to load
6. Enjoy your drone flight!

### Step 6: Troubleshooting

1. If a scene doesn't load in the correct location, try clicking the memberID number again and waiting for the scene to load
2. If the PC app doesn't generate a MemberID, try pasting the panoID again and clicking 'Submit' again (Sometimes the API doesn't respond or the internet is too slow to process before the timeout)
3. Check the length of the panoID before submitting (If it's too long and overflows the text box, it's likely incorrect)
4. If the drone doesn't move, try re-clicking a memberID number or the pre-set locations
5. Searching the istreetview website will take you to a rough location. Tips are to enter a postcode, cick the enter button, then manually search with the pegman icon to find a location you want to go to. Pegman can be found here where the image is in the bottom right corner of the screen, drag him to the map to open the streetview images:
